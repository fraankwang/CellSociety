### Refactoring

I refactored parts of the PredatorPrey grid. While working on it, I knew that there was a decent amount of duplicated logic that needed to be fixed. I took this opportunity to fix that by extracting some code into separate methods. Not only does this fix the code design wise, it also allows for better readability
