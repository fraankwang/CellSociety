CompSci 308: Cell Society Design
===================

> This is the link to the Design Description: [Plan - Cell Society](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci308/spring16/assign/02_cellsociety/part1.php)

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a program that runs multiple different types of Cellular Automata and displays it graphically. Our program will be flexible enough to deal with all the CAs specified in the assignment description.  Our code should be able to add even more types of CAs if needed.

The basic architecture of our program is as follows. There's a UI that will allow you to load in an XML file. Once that is loaded in, depending on the type of CA the XML file describes, the program creates a grid filled with cells that follow the rules of CA. 



### Overview

* Describe specific components, their purpose, and how they collaborate with each other
* Picture of how components are related (UML)

### User Interface
Users will load an XML file with the specifications for the CA. Once the file is loaded, they will be able to step through the CA or run it continuously and stop whenever they want. They can then exit that CA and load another XML file to run a different one.



* How will user interact with program (keep it very simple)
* Overall appearance of UI
* Pictures of UI
* Descrive erroneous situations that are reported to the user

### Design Details
* Describe components in detail, including extra sub-components
* For each component: how it handles specific features, what resources it uses, how it collaborates with others, how it can be extended
* Steps needed to complete use cases
* Justify the decision to create each component with respect to design's key goals/principles/abstractions

### Design Considerations
* Describe pros and cons of design decisions made
* Describe design issues that need to be addressed
* Assumptions or dependencies that impact overall design

### Team Responsibilities
* Describe how you will split up responsibility among teammates
